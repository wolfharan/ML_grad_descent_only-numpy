# ML_grad_descent_only-numpy
An implementation of Gradient Descent(from sratch, uses only Python and Numpy) to fit a line to the boston housing data set.  It is more faster and easier to acheive with a library like TensorFlow, but this implementation uses no other library except for numpy. This helps in understanding Gradient Descent at a deeper level.
